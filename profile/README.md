  <b>Des2Ract</b> is an advanced tool designed to convert Figma designs into structured React components.<br>
  Our approach involves analyzing Figma designs at a deep structural level to generate high-quality, maintainable UI code.
</p>

## Features

- **Figma to React Conversion**: Transforms Figma designs into reusable React components.
- **Semantic Understanding**: Uses machine learning to infer the best HTML elements based on structure and style.
- **Component Grouping**: Clusters related UI elements logically for better componentization.
- **Supports SHADCN UI**: Ensures integration with the SHADCN component library for a consistent design system.

## How It Works

1. **Extract Figma Nodes**: Parses Figma designs into a structured tree format.
2. **Assign Semantics**: Predicts appropriate HTML elements based on design context.
3. **Logical Grouping**: Merges related elements into logical React components.
4. **React Code Generation**: Outputs clean, maintainable React components.
